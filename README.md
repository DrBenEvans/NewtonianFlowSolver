# NewtonianFlowSolver
This is a MATLAB-based Newtonian flow solver for hypersonic flow modelling.  It was developed as a series of undergraduate research projects, under the supervision of Prof Ken Morgan and Dr Ben Evans, at the Aerospace Department of Swansea University.  There are two versions of the code (2D and 3D) and geometries can be loaded as standard shapes, NACA aerofoils, user-defined geometries of .stl files in 3D.

The thesis of Bagwell explains the theory behind the basic Newtonian solver implementation with details on how to run the code.

The paper of Smalley explains how the code was modified to take into account free stream Mach number effects as well as a range of validation case studies.

In the folder 'Code' you will find the MATLAB code for both 2D and 3D Newtonian flow solvers as well as a range of example geometry files that can be used.
